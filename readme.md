## FAQ


#### What is Orchid?
Orchid is a package for Laravel which helps with the administration of the application on Laravel, allowing you to write code as you want, control of routing/themes/plugins/etc - none of this and will not be! The package only gives a good set of tools that will be in demand in almost every project.

#### Is it necessary to use the built-in recordings?
We assume that most of your records will be stored in json, which will allow you to do the translation and the universal structure, but if the rails have goals like a CRM system with harsh conditions, then of course you can use the classic CRUD yourself, orchids will not stop you.

#### Are there any additional system requirements from Laravel?
Yes, you need a PHP extension for image processing and support for json type your database.

#### How much does it cost?
Orchid is free, but we appreciate donations.
